    The List of Content Models

In HTML, elements typically belonged in either the block level or inline content model. HTML5 introduces seven main content models.

- Metadata
- Embedded
- Interactive
- Heading
- Phrasing
- Flow
- Sectioning
The HTML5 content models are designed to make the markup structure more meaningful for both the browser and the web designer.


Content Models

Metadata: Content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content. These elements are found in the head of the document.
Elements: <base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title> <script and style may be used in body as well>

Embedded: Content that imports other resources into the document.
Elements: <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>

Interactive: Content specifically intended for user interaction.
Elements: <a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>

Heading: Defines a section header.
Elements: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>

Phrasing: This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.
Elements: <img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>, and more.

Flow content: Contains the majority of HTML5 elements that would be included in the normal flow of the document.

Sectioning content: Defines the scope of headings, content, navigation, and footers.
Elements: <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>

    The various content models overlap in certain areas, depending on how they are being used.
    *FEM HIPS try to remember them with these two words*   ok is see babem let these stay here much good notes  Good ok but you'll get thenm in SOloLearn anyways also be curious with the 
    comment sectins they really help with noobs like us indeed indeed i shall cool
    so you do realize what the default character encoding in HTML5 is, right? that array of words means nothingto me 
    okay so think of it like these. Bytes are sent around with specific encodings in terms of bits and how they're interpreted by the receiver right?
    so the  default encoding for html5 documents is specified as utf-8 yes so what we basicalyy do is define it in the head sectiona as a part of our meta data     These are little but
    effective SEO tips to keep things standard rightttt it says it on the right bottom too so iwf hietsr stea ndard then why define right right isee all sortas
    because for example one might be dealing with an older system or renewing a document or stuff like that also there are different HTML versions that might be used for
    compatibility or other purposes which might use different character encodings vay iseee babem i see YES YES so  yes you exlpain that one yesterday
    another meta description we need is the view port which sets the user's display width as the base of the scales for the interpretation right also it's a really important thing to do
    because as we saw around 80% of devices used on the internet are mobile devices with smaller screens than us developers' 
    mobile optimization of sitessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss, baba why you no exlpain on ready code that i can look at while you exlpain 
    That is called reactive design I think so anyways another thing is the direction attribute for the html elemeent which is based on the language's direction either right to left (rtl) or the other way around (ltr)
    Because I asked you to google them baba Good boi
 fuck google i dont find shit but is ok i do get all so far, or i think i do
 ok then swait a sec thank bbab ahhhhh
